# 100daysofAlgorithms
### 100 days of algorithms  This repository contains notebooks with live code to accompany [100 days of algorithms]

I set the challenge for myself to implement algorithm by algorithm, day by day, until the number reaches **100**.

The challenge will be quite fun and rough, as well. Do not expect the implementations to be the best, nor fastest, nor nicest, nor bug-free. Do expect to see code written in haste. A code that contains the same amount of enthusiasm and love to algorithms as many it contains bugs.

Feel free to (re)use my code in any way you wish, but bare in mind that the source code is provided "as-is". It is on your own risk and you are solely responsible for whatever happens then.
